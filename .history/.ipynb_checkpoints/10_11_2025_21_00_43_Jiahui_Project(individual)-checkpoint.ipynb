    "(1) K-NN can capture complex patterns between play time, age and experience level without assuming specific functional forms\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) By using the k-nn classification, we don't need strong statistical assumptions about the data distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.2 Potential limitations\n",
    "(1) Prediction time increases with training set size\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Outliers in played_hours may mislead classification\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.3 Model Development Plan\n",
    "(1)**Setting**\n",
    "- Set seed for splitting data in order to ensure the reproducibility of the process.\n",
    "- Remove invalid observations(NA).\n",
    "- Standardize predictors('played_hours' and 'Age')\n",
    "- Split the data with the proportion 0.7, which means 70% for training, 30% for testing.\n",
    "- Ensure proportional representation of all experience levels.\n",
    "  \n",
    "(2)**Tuning**\n",
    "- Use cross-validation with 5-fold CV on the training set to find the best k value for building the model specification.\n",
    "- Try the k value from 1 to 30, step by 1.\n",
    "  \n",
    "(3)**Evaluation**\n",
    "- Apply the best k value and find out the accuracy, precision, and recall of the model.\n",
    "- Make and analyze a confusion matrix."
